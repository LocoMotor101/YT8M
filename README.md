This is the README of the branch Test 01.
I might be lost here, but I am trying to follow the "help" section.
Since I do not know anything about programming, I might not be clear
on what steps I should follow here. I started this because it said
I could start without knowning any GIT and get help from experts.
I am not clear if I should start with some basic GIT programme, or
is it possible to get started by somebody knowledgeable on GIT?
Thank, Oscar
