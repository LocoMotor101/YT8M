Exploring YT8M database
This repository was created in order to support a research project about co-relations between different users in YouTube.
Specifically, it intends to understand what other YouTube channels users visit and comment in addition to the targeted channels.
We would like to see relational information about age, geographical origin, types of comments, main language use, and types of
other channels visited and commented.
Our research is purely academic and do not entail any commercial value. The broader research project is about "aesthetics of the
videography made with mobile phone cameras".
